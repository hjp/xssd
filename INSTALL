1) GNU make required

    The supplied GNUmakefile uses a few extensions of GNU make (like
    include). Other versions of make may or may not work.

2) GNUmakevars and GNUmakerules

    The GNUmakefile includes two files with a few commonly useful
    definitions. You may have to edit these files to adjust them to your
    system. You can also move them to a central place where gnu make can
    find them (like /usr/local/include). 

    GNUmakevars is automatically generated from a shell script if it
    isn't found. If this happens, a warning about target "/" being
    multiply defined in GNUmakerules is printed, which can be ignored.

3) run "make"

4) run "make install" as root

    xssd needs to be installed setuid root.

5) If you want to build an RPM, run "make rpm" instead of steps 3 and 4.
    For a Redhat default setup, you need to root to do that and the
    source and binary RPMs will be put below /usr/src/redhat. You also
    need to have configured RPM for signing packages.
