1) GNU make required

    The supplied GNUmakefile uses a few extensions of GNU make (like
    include). Other versions of make may or may not work.

2) GNUmakevars and GNUmakerules

    The GNUmakefile includes two files with a few commonly useful
    definitions. You may have to edit these files to adjust them to your
    system. You can also move them to a central place where gnu make can
    find them (like /usr/local/include). 

3) run "make all"

4) run "make install" as root

    xssd needs to be installed setuid root.
