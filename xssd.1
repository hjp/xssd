.SH NAME
xssd - extremely simple sudo
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xssd
.I user
.I command
[
.I args ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xssd
allows execution of commands as another user similar to sudo or setuid bits. 
Unlike sudo, however, it is intended to be extremely simple and
therefore easy to verify for correctness. Unlike setuid bits, it logs
each invocation to syslog, filters environment variables and is more
flexible in granting access to different users.
.PP
On startup, 
.B xssd
reads the file \fB/etc/xssd/\fIuser\fB/\fIcommand\fR, which contains
lines in the format Keyword: Value. The Keywords are case sensitive,
whitespace around the value is ignored. Lines which don't match this
pattern and unrecognized keywords are ignored. The following keywords are
recognized:
.TP Command
The full path of the command to be executed. argv[0] will still be taken
from the command line.
.TP User
The user name of a user allowed to execute this command
.TP Group
The group name of a group allowed to execute this command
.TP Env
The name of an environment variable which is passed through to the
command unchanged. All environment variables not mentioned in the
configuration file are discarded.
.PP
Then xssd sets the gid, auxiliary groups and uid to that of the target 
.I user
and executes the command.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Intended to be self-explanatory. All diagnostics are printed to stderr
and sent to syslog.
